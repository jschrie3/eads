# eads

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `eads` is to provide local data users access to both canned
and custom data tables at a variety of [Census geographies]() and
[spatial extents](). This is a joint project the [SLU
openGIS](https://slu-opengis.github.io) effort and the [St. Louis
Regional Data Alliance]().

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/eads")
```

## What’s in a Name?

`eads` is a reference to the [Eads
Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eads_Bridge), the first bridge
erected across the Mississippi River in St. Louis and an iconic landmark
in the region. Like its namesake, `eads` provides a link between
disparate corners of the region, ensuring we can paint a unified
portrait with data instead of steel.
